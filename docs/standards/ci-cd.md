# CI/CD Golden Path

This document defines the baseline CI/CD workflow expected for projects using burnly-api.

## Pull Request Gates (Required)

On every PR:

1. Quality gates

- lint
- format check
- typecheck
- environment example/schema check (`npm run verify:env`)
- Prisma schema/generation drift check (`npm run verify:prisma`)
- dependency boundary check (architecture rules + cycle detection)
- architecture smell scan (`npm run smells:arch:ci`; fail on new findings at/above configured severity)

2. Test gates

- unit tests
- unit coverage report artifact (`npm run test:coverage`; no threshold during initial baseline phase)
- integration tests (real Postgres/Redis via Docker Compose or Testcontainers)
- e2e tests for critical flows (as the project grows)

3. Contract gates (non-negotiable)

- generate OpenAPI from code and compare with committed snapshot (`docs/openapi/openapi.yaml`)
- run Spectral lint on the OpenAPI artifact using `.spectral.yaml`

Meta gate (recommended):

- prove the gates are effective (OpenAPI drift and boundary violations are caught): `npm run verify:gates`

Local CI mirror:

- `npm run verify:ci-local` runs the non-Docker CI sequence, including Prisma client generation, quality gates, scaffold smoke, architecture smell scan, contract gates, gate honesty, and runtime dependency audit.
- Prisma migration status remains in the Docker-backed lane because it requires a live database.
- The local CI mirror also generates the duplication self-review reports (`npm run duplication:report`). Findings are non-fatal during the initial tuning phase.
- `npm run verify:e2e` remains the explicit Docker-backed lane for Postgres/Redis/MinIO, migrations, integration tests, and e2e tests.

4. Security gates (baseline)

- secret scanning (pre-merge)
- dependency scanning (best-effort)
- runtime dependency vulnerability audit (`npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high`)

Reference implementation:

- GitHub Actions workflow: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

## Architecture Smell Baseline Governance

- Baseline updates must be explicit and reviewed.
- The smell scan refuses baseline writes unless `ARCH_SMELLS_BASELINE_APPROVED=true` is set for the update command.
- PR summaries must include smell impact by phase (`new/reduced/unchanged`) to keep trend visibility.

## Build + Release (Baseline)

On main branch merges:

- Build a production Docker image (immutable, tagged by commit SHA).
- Publish artifacts to the registry.
- Record `service.version` for observability (logs/traces).

## Migrations (Production Safety)

Guideline:

- Run DB migrations as an explicit, gated step (e.g., `prisma migrate deploy`) before or during deploy.
- Prefer “expand/contract” migrations for zero-downtime changes.

## Deploy (Baseline)

Deployment should:

- use environment-provided configuration and secrets
- roll out safely (blue/green or rolling with health/readiness checks)
- verify readiness before shifting traffic

## Changelog / Tagging

Baseline expectations (can be automated later):

- release tags
- changelog entries for contract changes
- documented migration steps when schema changes
