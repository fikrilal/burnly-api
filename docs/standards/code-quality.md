# Code Quality Standard

This document defines the minimum code quality bar for burnly-api and all projects built from it.

This is not “style preference”. These rules exist to reduce production defects, speed up reviews, and keep the codebase maintainable over years.

## Non-Negotiables

- TypeScript **strict mode** is enabled.
- `any` is **forbidden** (no `any`, no `as any`, no implicit `any`).
- Architectural boundaries are **automatically enforced** in CI (no “trust review” for layering).
- Formatting is automated (Prettier) and never debated in PRs.
- Logging must be structured (no `console.*`); use the platform logger wiring (`libs/platform/logging/logging.module.ts`).

See ADRs:

- `docs/adr/0013-typescript-strict-no-any.md`
- `docs/adr/0014-enforce-architecture-boundaries.md`

## TypeScript Rules

### Strictness

Required compiler posture:

- `strict: true` (includes `noImplicitAny`)

Recommended additional flags (adopt early if possible):

- `useUnknownInCatchVariables: true`
- `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch: true`
- `noImplicitOverride: true`

### No `any` Policy

Rules:

- Do not use `any` in source code.
- Do not “escape hatch” with `as any` or `// eslint-disable` to bypass typing.
- Use `unknown` for untrusted values, then narrow/parse.

Acceptable alternatives:

- `unknown` + runtime validation (DTO validation or schema parsing)
- discriminated unions
- generics with constraints
- explicit DTOs / interfaces

### Type Assertions

Rules:

- Prefer narrowing via guards over `as`.
- Assertions must be local and justified by an invariant (e.g., “we already validated DTO at boundary”).
- Never assert across trust boundaries (e.g., request body, webhook payload, job payload, external API response) without validation.

### Null/Undefined Discipline

Rules:

- Avoid nullable/optional values in “core” domain types. Prefer explicit variants.
- When values may be missing, model it explicitly and handle it deliberately.

## Linting & Formatting

### ESLint (Type-Aware)

Linting should be type-aware and treated as a correctness tool, not a style tool.

Required categories:

- no unused vars/imports
- no floating promises
- correct promise usage in async contexts
- no implicit `any` / no explicit `any`
- consistent type-only imports
- no `console.*` (use structured logger)

Rule posture:

- Prefer `error` for correctness/safety rules.
- Avoid “warning debt” (warnings ignored become permanent).

### Prettier

Prettier is the formatting source of truth:

- run via `npm run format`
- enforced in CI (format check)

Do not bike-shed formatting in reviews.

## Architectural Boundaries (Hard Requirement)

Burnly API architecture is only valuable if enforced.

### Layering Rule

Within a feature:

```text
infra  -> app  -> domain
```

Rules:

- `domain` must not import `app`, `infra`, or `platform`.
- `app` must not import `infra` or Nest/Prisma/Redis/BullMQ.
- `infra` may import `app`, `domain`, and `platform` adapters as needed.

### Package Rule

Top-level structure:

- `apps/*` are process bootstraps (API/worker).
- `libs/platform/*` is cross-cutting infrastructure.
- `libs/features/*` are vertical slices.

Rules:

- `libs/platform/*` must not depend on `libs/features/*` (platform must stay reusable).
- `apps/api/*` and `apps/worker/*` may depend on `libs/platform/*` and `libs/features/*`.

### Enforcing Boundaries (Automated)

Boundaries must be enforced by an automated tool in CI (not just review).

Baseline expectation:

- detect forbidden imports (layer violations)
- detect circular dependencies
- fail CI on violations

See ADR: boundary enforcement tool + config will be codified and versioned with the repo.

## Duplication Detection

Token-based clone detection is a self-review harness, not a replacement for
architecture smell rules.

Baseline expectation:

- run `npm run duplication:report` when changes introduce or reshape shared logic
- keep raw jscpd output out of git
- review categorized findings in `_WIP/duplication-report.md` and `_WIP/small-helper-duplication-report.md`
- record reviewed acceptable duplicates in the relevant allowlist with rationale

See: `docs/engineering/duplication-harness.md`.

## Dependency Injection & Instantiation

Rules:

- Do not instantiate services inside other services/controllers with `new`.
- Use Nest DI for infra/http wiring and platform integrations.
- Keep constructors side-effect free (no network calls, no DB queries).

Rationale:

- testability
- consistent lifecycle control
- avoids hidden coupling

## Error Handling Discipline

Rules:

- Use the standardized error model (problem-details + stable `code`).
- Do not throw raw strings.
- Do not leak internal details in error responses.
- When constructing app/feature errors, do not use raw string `code` values; use enums (`ErrorCode` for global, feature enums for feature-specific).
- Feature error classes must type `code` as a union of global + feature codes (e.g., `FeatureErrorCode | ErrorCode`) to prevent drift.

See:

- `docs/standards/api-response-standard.md`
- `docs/standards/error-codes.md`

## Time Handling

Rules:

- App services must not call `new Date()` / `Date.now()` directly (except inside a `SystemClock` implementation).
- Prefer injecting `Clock` (`libs/shared/time.ts`) into app services and deriving `now` from it.
- Prefer passing `now` explicitly across ports/repositories when persistence must be deterministic.
- Worker handlers should avoid hidden wall-clock reads when the timestamp affects persistence, retries, idempotency, or externally visible behavior. Prefer an explicit `now` parameter or injected `Clock`; direct worker clock reads are reported by the architecture smell scanner for review.
- In unit tests, prefer a fixed clock over Jest fake timers.

## Logging Discipline

Rules:

- Use structured logging only.
- No secrets in logs, ever.
- Prefer IDs and correlation fields over raw user data.

- `docs/standards/observability.md`
- `docs/standards/security.md`
